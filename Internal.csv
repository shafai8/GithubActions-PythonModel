"Created webflow to HubSpot and Mailchimp to HubSpot apps.

Note: As you can see connected app cards are not bottom aligned, It's due to the different sizes of icons. We have already conveyed this to the designer He is creating the icons with the same size, So the alignment issue will be resolved.
@ahmadziaKhokar will update the icons on HubSpot.",Merged
